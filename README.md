# IoT and Digital Image based Smart Parking 
Website-based parking system using IOT

 IoT based smart parking system that integrates IR sensors with the Arduino to check the availability of parking slots. The website allows the user to book the slotonline and with the help of the GSM module the user is navigated to the Parking Space. The vehicle authentication is done with the help of image processing which detects the number plate of the vehicle. This proposed system reduces the driver's effort and time in searching the parking slot and time taken by the driver to find a vacant parking slot which in turn reduces the amount of fuel used, traffic, and air pollution.
